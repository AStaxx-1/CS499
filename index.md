## Welcome to my CS 499 ePortfolio

This portfolio is the culmination of my work in the SNHU Computer Science Program, and will continuously be updated throughout the duration of my capstone course. Have a look below to watch my process and see the portfolio grow.

### Code Review

This review was intended to look-over and critique the code I am using to make enhancements on. The code review coveres a few different programs that I have submitted to enhance, and lays out how I plan to make these enhancements throughout CS 499. The code review has three sections: Software Engineering and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. Each of these sections has initial code and planned enhancements associated with them. Please use the link to access and view my [code review](https://youtu.be/3gtrRmnn6po) for this portfolio.
