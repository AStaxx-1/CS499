## Welcome to my CS 499 ePortfolio

This portfolio is the culmination of my work in the SNHU Computer Science Program, and will continuously be updated throughout the duration of my capstone course. Have a look below to watch my process and see the portfolio grow.

### Code Review

This review was intended to look-over and critique the code I am using to make enhancements on. The code review coveres a few different programs that I have submitted to enhance, and lays out how I plan to make these enhancements throughout CS 499. The code review has three sections: Software Engineering and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. Each of these sections has initial code and planned enhancements associated with them. Please use the link to access and view my [code review](https://youtu.be/3gtrRmnn6po) for this portfolio. 


### Software Design and Engineering

The artifact I chose for the Software Engineering and Design portion of the final project is my Final Project from Computer Science 340. This project created a RESTful API that linked to a Mongo Database. The REST API was created using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Plotly Dash to create a dashboard to display database information, a pie chart, and location data for the table created from the database information. This project was created between January and February of 2021, and through the course of the project creation I learned about REST APIs and learned how to do client-side scripting for client-server development. This was an area that I hadn’t worked with much before, and the project as designed only reads from the database and doesn’t make use of the rest of the CRUD module created for it. 

This artifact was included in my ePortfolio because it was one of the most difficult projects I worked on during the course of my degree, and it 	shows my ability to create a product that meets a client’s objectives. This artifact was created with the intent of enabling a rescue training company to work with local animal shelters to find animals that meet specific criteria to begin rescue training. This artifact also showed my ability to use innovative skills and techniques for the design solutions. My original artifact is already a good example of this because I show how I moved from using buttons to radio selection items when I realized that the radio items would work better for the requested features. 

Currently, I am still completing the work needed to display that I am able to complete the ideas I articulated. I was able to update the software design to include a user entry section, but there is still improvement needed for the logic and troubleshooting to determine why entries are not being added to the database. I have met some of the course objectives I initially laid out in Module 1 and through my Code Review, but have not achieved all of the goals I had set for myself with this Milestone. I spent more time focused on building the environment than I should have, and I should have started this earlier instead of waiting and trying to gain access to an older environment. 

While updating and modifying this artifact I had to modify it to work on the new operating system and update the authentication portion of the CRUD module created to ensure that it was able to successfully access the database. I also modified the naming convention for the CRUD module so that it made more sense with the project than keeping the names used to submit homework. After getting my environment up and running and ensuring the original project was able to run without issues I began making my enhancements. My large planned enhancement for this project was adding a user entry section so that users could add entries to the database to keep this project in continued use. While I was adding this enhancement I learned more about the core components of Plotly Dash, and learned how to add more sections to the interface. I also learned how to use those input components of Plotly Dash, and realized that to enable user entries I would have to use a separate input section for each of the dictionary components and then write those entries into a new dictionary before adding it to the database. I then added some logic for the button, so that the entry would be added if the number of button clicks was greater than a comparison number. After the button clicks n_clicks would increase, and then theoretically it would go through the IF loop I created to add that entry to the database and re-read the whole database to the dataframe being used to display the data. The design of the dashboard has been updated so this new section appears to the user, but I cannot determine why when the Create method is being called the program is not adding the entry to the database. This is a challenge that I still have not been able to overcome, but I am working on looking up resources and re-evaluating the logic I am using to determine where the error is. 

During my updates I also re-evaluated the location data logic, and cannot determine why two of my radio selections only update the pie-chart and not the location data. The pie-chart and the location data follow the same logic to get the data from the viewData being created by the table, so I am not sure why one updates and the other doesn’t. This logic is still being evaluated. I feel confident that given more time I will be able to address the issue with my user entries and gain a better understanding of the location data issue. The past two to three weeks I have focused more on gaining access to my old environment instead of just rebuilding and starting on the project, so given more time I am sure that I will be able to course-correct and achieve my enhancement goals.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

The artifacts chosen for the Data Structure and Algorithms section of the final project are a Linked List program and a Binary Search Tree program that I created during CS 260. These artifacts were chosen because they came from a course that was based solely on the creation, use, and understanding of data structures and algorithms. These programs show the use of multiple data structures and algorithms specifically tailored to those structures. The programs as artifacts showed by ability to create algorithms to complete tasks for uses and display the results. Each of these artifacts had similar algorithms already including load, search, and delete algorithms that enabled a user to load information from a csv and display it to the screen and then search and delete information. The programs both lacked a sorting algorithm, or a method for which the user to choose to sort their data. 

For the Linked List artifact, the enhancement I made was to add an insertion sort algorithm. When the course first started I proposed a merge sort for this program, but realized that as a singly linked list I could do an insertion sort for the program instead. This insertion sort algorithm sorts the information by Bid Id so that the bids are sorted from lowest to highest bid id when the user chooses the sort option. Also during these enhancements, I ensured that I was adding the necessary comments and removing the fix-me comments I noticed during the code review to really clean up the program. This enhancement showcased my ability to not only return to an old program and understand it in depth but showed my ability to program a solution to solve a logic problem in the program. Initially the program just read in the csv and spit out the few pieces of information we needed. By adding this sorting algorithm I could easily build on it to enable sorting by other portions of the bid, not just the bid Id. The enhancement I added to this program did not meet the specific goal I had in mind for creating a merge sort, but it did meet my goal to have a sorting algorithm added to enhance the usability of the program. Although the enhancement was not exactly what I initially planned, it still met the course objective I planned to meet for this part of the final project. I do not have any more updates to make to this program to complete it for the final project, pending any instructor feedback after submission. 

The other program I enhanced for this portion of the final project was a Binary Search Tree Program. I initially intended to add a sorting algorithm to this program to increase usability and display my skills, but I realized that the sorting algorithm for this program would be less efficient that updating my current algorithms to allow a user to choose how they would like the Binary Search Tree results displayed. After playing around with sending the binary search tree to an array, and then returning the data to a binary search tree I realized it was going to be more efficient to reload the data depending on how the user wanted to display it. To do this I provided more options for the user on their input page, and updated the insert algorithm to reflect. Now the program default loads the information based on the bid id, but provides the user the opportunity to choose between each of the pieces of information displayed for each bid. To do this I adjusted the insert algorithm originally created for the program to have if/if else statements that determine what factor is used to choose the insertion of each bid. Although the way I went about adding this enhancement was different than originally planned, it still displays my ability to solve logic problems using algorithms. It also demonstrated my ability to look at the efficiency of what I have planned and use innovative skills and techniques to solve the problem. I was able to take what I originally planned and understand a better way to implement for this program. I still met the course objectives I originally intended to meet with this enhancement and artifact. 

Throughout the process of enhancing both of these artifacts I continuously took the time to step back and ask myself if what I was doing was efficient and made the most sense. This is a process that I try to implement not just for my programs but my daily life and it paid off through this process because I was able to identify a better and more sound way to achieve my plans for both of these programs. One of the challenges I faced during these enhancements was adjusting my lab environment to be able to work again. Since completing CS260 my laptop has had a couple updates, and one of the updates I made caused Eclipse to not be able to run my programs. There is a compatibility error with Mac and the debugger that Eclipse uses by default, and in the process of keeping my laptop up-to-date I unknowingly caused a compatibility issue that wouldn’t enable my programs to build or debug. I was able to solve this by downloading a more recent version of GDB and create a certificate that enabled the programs to work properly. Throughout the first two milestones I have realized how much more difficult things can be when you aren’t given a lab environment, and it’s made me realize that I need to stay on top of updates and issues that can impact my ability to work on my projects. This was a big lesson for me because most of the classes I was in gave us a working lab environment, so I never had to worry about these things before but now I know what to look for an how to fix several errors. 

### Databases

The artifact I selected for the Database portion of the final project was an excel version of my book collection that I imported into a MongoDB. This was an incredibly simple artifact that did not have any code created for it before starting this milestone. The final project rubric recommended creating a MongoDB interface from HTML and JavaScript for the enhancement in this milestone, and I have never built and interface like this from scratch. I first created the excel version of my data at the beginning of the course. This artifact was included because I wanted to show my adaptability and innovation when working with databased. I had the opportunity to do something that I thought would be easier, modifying an already working interface to match this data but decided to go with something new and a little more personally challenging to showcase my ability to learn quickly and adjust to new programming languages and requirements. 

This artifact was improved greatly during this enhancement. I started with an excel sheet that had the information for my personal library and imported it into MongoDB to create a new database and collection. Once the database was created, I moved on to creating the interface using Node.js and Express. I built this project from the ground up, and my interface has an initial welcome page and links to the other two pages I build for the interface. The first page lists all the entries in the database and a link to the previous page. The second page provides the user the opportunity to add data to the database from the interface and includes a link to the “book list” page as well as the “welcome” page. All the pages available are completely functional and the links between the pages all work. The enhancements I made to this project showed that I can program solutions for storing and accessing data in a database. If I were to continue working on this project in the future, I would want to add user authentication to make it more secure. I know how to add the security to the database itself but could not quite reach the ability for a user to enter a username and password and move to the next page of the interface. 

I met the initial objects I laid out during Module One and pending any feedback from the instructor I do not believe I will have many, if any at all, adjustments to make to this enhancement. While I was enhancing this project, I learned a lot about HTML. Before this project I had minimal experience with HTML, but since working on this I have learned a lot and learned that HTML is a lot simpler than I initially believed. Given more time I know that I could create better looking interfaces with more functionality based on my experience with this project. For this project one of the challenges I faced was how to make the interface functional for a user, so I had to think about the things that I expect out of the interfaces I work with. The interface I created was very basic but gets the point across well and is functional enough that a user would be able to walk up and use it. Another challenge I faced was that I was able to add authentication to the database itself but struggling to integrate the code with that authentication. In the end I removed the authentication requirement from the database because it was hindering my ability to connect to the database at all, but it is something that I kept in mind during the project. One of the things I have learned in cybersecurity is the more secure we make a system the more difficult access/use is for an average user, and that is something I encountered when working on this enhancement. Adding the authentication requirement to the database made it more secure, but it also made it harder for me to get the program to connect.
